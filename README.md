### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
- **Chicago**
-  **New York City**
- **Washington**

The code imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also  contains script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

### Files used
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- chicago.csv
